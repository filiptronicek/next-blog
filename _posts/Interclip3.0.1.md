<p>In version 3.0.1 there has been added the ability to upload images and directly get a code.
To try that feature, you can do so <a href="http://uni.hys.cz/image">here</a>
(or you can go to the home page and there in the menu is the Send image button)</p>
<p>Also, when you then go to the receive link page and enter a code that contains a link to jpeg, jpg, gif or a png (this might get changed in the future) there is an image preview</p>

<p>Talking about image previews, when you enter a link containing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> URL it will generate a video preview in both the send and receive sections</p>
