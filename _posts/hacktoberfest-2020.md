Howdy, my developer friends. It's October, which means, that apart from [Techtober](https://mobilesyrup.com/2020/09/30/techtober-2020/) and [Oktoberfest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oktoberfest) (which will sadly not take place this year), there is an event celebrating Open Source, called Hacktoberfest.

## What is Hacktoberfest?
Hacktoberfest is a monthlong celebration of Open Source, organized by Dev.to, DigitalOcean and this year even Intel has joined in the fun. This year's challenge is to complete 4 Pull Requests, which are:
1. accepted
2. in a repo, with the `hacktoberfest` topic ([why](https://web.archive.org/web/20201222103134/https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/hacktoberfest-update))

If you do that, your PRs will be in a review period over the next 14 days, and after that, you can choose, whether you want a t-shirt or to plant a tree.
