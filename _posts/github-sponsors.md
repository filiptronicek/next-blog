Yesterday, on June 9th, 2020, I set up GitHub Sponsors. I didn't expect much of it, because I'm no grown adult, who has an actual work. I just started out doing open source, symbolically by contributing to [open-sauced/open-sauced](https://github.com/open-sauced/open-sauced). Although it wasn't my first open-source project (my own [Interclip](https://github.com/aperta-principium/Interclip), was), I hope it's going to be the most successful one.
To my surprise, after not even 24 hours after I set it up,  I got my first sponsor! I cannot describe the feeling when I read the e-mail from GitHub. It's so lovely, that after my three years of coding, I finally got a kind gift from someone. This gift is a different one, though; I want to use it to fulfill my long-term dream of having a personal domain. I really can't thank [@bdougieYO](https://twitter.com/bdougieYO/) enough for this, because it really put a big smile on my face today.
