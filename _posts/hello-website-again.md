On May 14, 2019, I officially published my website sitting at [filiptronicek.github.io](https://filiptronicek.github.io). It all was pretty good, but I wanted an alternative. For some reason, I couldn't get GitHub pages set up with HTTPS. I hated seeing the `not secure` warning in my browser (although I solved this a couple weeks ago by routing through CloudFlare). I also wanted to have a static webpage, no builds, just static assets. I didn't exactly need anything fancy for my profile landing page. Thanks to my [sponsors and donors](https://thanks.trnck.dev/), I was able to buy a domain, which at the end turned out to be trnck.dev (my surname without any vowels). The TLD .dev was chosen, because I think that the .codes TLD is a bit long and .com is commercial, so .dev seemed like the best option. It is hosted by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/dashboard), so pretty neat. So, go check it out. I am going to work on it in the following weeks, so expect a lot of cool stuff!
